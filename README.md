## About Me

I'm a full-stack student at UCB and a father of soon-to-be two. I'm locked in and excited for what may come next. In the past, I was raised as a boy scout and went on to do animal care at Keepers of the Wild and then three years as a CNA in rehab facilities. I work attentively and put the same stress and care into my projects as I do with my children. In my free time I work with my Father and brother in their home business I help edit their YouTube videos.
