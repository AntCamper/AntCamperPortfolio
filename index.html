        <h2> Anthony Jones ~ Aspiring Web Developer and Dedicated Family Man</h2>
<p>
Hello, I'm Anthony Jones, a passionate student at the UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp, embarking on an exciting journey into the world of web development. 
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
In my previous professional chapters, I dedicated several years as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), where compassion and empathy were the driving forces behind my work. Prior to that, I found fulfillment working at "Keepers of the Wild," an animal park, in Valentine I specialized in care for primates and bears.

<h3>Educational Pursuits </h3> 
Currently enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension Bootcamp, I am fervently diving into the realm of web development. This career change represents my commitment to continuous learning and growth, seeking to master the skills needed to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

<h3>Family First</h3>
Above all, I am a dedicated father, soon to be of two. My family is my driving force, providing the motivation and support to pursue my dreams. Balancing the responsibilities of both family life and professional development, I am committed to creating a better future for us all.
